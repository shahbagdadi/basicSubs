# Basic Monthly Subscription 

## Background Information: 	
Netflix offers customers 3 service plans (1S, 2S, & 4S) based on the number of concurrent streams and priced accordingly.As we are a global service, we have defined prices for each service plan for country we support.For each customer we know the service plan (1S, 2S, or 4S), the price for the chosen plan and the country of the customer.  

## Problem Statement:
Netflix rolls out price changes for our service periodically.  
In order to accurately and effective change the prices of 100M+ customers, we need to have a systematic solution for changing prices.  

## Objective:
Design and implement a system that hosts Netflix pricing which will enable us to systematically change prices across all our global customers.  
We want to see how your system supports price changes pushed by country.
